    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There’s nothing quite like sitting around a table with friends, demolishing slices of tortilla española while a few 
        too many Estrella Galicias quietly turn everyone into expert food critics. Each bite is followed by exaggerated nods, 
        unsolicited opinions about onion placement, and at least one person insisting they could “definitely make this at home” 
        (they cannot). The tortillas keep coming, the beers keep disappearing, and somehow the conversation gets louder while 
        the logic gets softer.</p>
    <p>Through it all, one truth remains unquestionable: la tortilla mi suegra es la mejor, and this is not up for debate. It’s 
        perfectly cooked, impossibly comforting, and somehow tastes even better after the third beer, when everyone agrees it’s 
        life-changing and possibly magical. By the end of the night, we’re full, happy, and slightly wobbly — united by 
        friendship, Estrella Galicia, and the unquestioned supremacy of her tortilla.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon of<strong>Olive Oil</strong></li>
        <li>2 large <strong>Potatos</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Peper</strong> <em>to taste</em></li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of <strong>Smoked Paprika</strong> <em>to taste></em></li>
        <li>1 <strong>Sweet Spanish Onion</strong> <em>thinly sliced</em></li>
        <li>6 <strong>Large Eggs</strong></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of <strong>Olive Oil</strong></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of <strong>Olive Oil</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>STEP 1</strong> <em>Peel the potatoes and slice them thinly (about coin-thickness). 
            Slice the onion thin as well if using it (many do, some don’t — friendly arguments welcome).
        </em></li>
        <li><strong>STEP 2</strong> <em>Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a pan over medium-low heat. 
            Add the potatoes (and onion). Cook slowly, stirring gently, until they’re soft and tender — 
            not crispy. Season with salt.
        </em></li>
        <li><strong>STEP 3</strong> <em>Remove the potatoes from the oil using a slotted spoon and let them 
            drain. Save the oil — it’s full of flavor. Let the potatoes cool for a minute so they don’t scramble 
            the eggs.
        </em></li>
        <li><strong>STEP 4</strong> <em>Beat the eggs in a large bowl with salt. Add the warm potatoes and gently 
            mix, letting them rest together for a few minutes so the flavors combine.</em></li>
        <li><strong>STEP 5</strong> <em>Heat a little of the reserved oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add 
            the egg-potato mixture and spread it evenly. Cook until the bottom is set but the top is still 
            slightly runny.</em></li>
        <li><strong>STEP 6</strong> <em>Place a plate over the pan, flip the tortilla, then slide it back into the 
            pan to cook the other side. Cook briefly until just set — traditionally soft and creamy inside.</em></li>
        <li><strong>STEP 7</strong> <em>Enjoy!</em></li>
    </ol>
