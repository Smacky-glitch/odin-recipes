    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Irish Potatos are a traditional Philadelphia confection made from a smooth mixture of 
    cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and coconut, shaped into small balls and rolled in cinnamon to 
    resemble tiny potatos. Dispite the name, it contains no potatos at all. The "potato" look comes purely from its 
    size, shape, and cinnamon coating. The dessert is especially popular around St. Patrick's Day and is closely
    associated with Irish-American communities in the region.</p>
    <p>The treat is belived to have originated in the late 19th or early 20th century, likely as a homemade candy 
        among working-class families. Over time, it became a local speciality, now produced by well-known 
        Philadelphia bakeries. While it remains relatively unknown outside the area, Irish Potatos are a 
        <strong>beloved</strong> part of Philadelphia's food culture and a nostalgic seasonal favorite. <em>Enjoy!</em>
