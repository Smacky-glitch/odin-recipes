    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Authentic Patatas Bravas</strong> are a sacred Spanish institution and absolutely 
        not just fried potatoes with sauce. No, these are different potatoes — cut with passion, 
        fried with destiny, and topped with a sauce recipe that is apparently guarded more closely 
        than national secrets. As a gringo, I approach the plate with deep respect, nodding thoughtfully 
        while thinking, “Yes, these are… definitely potatoes,” and pretending I can detect the subtle regional 
        nuances between spicy tomato sauce and slightly spicier tomato sauce.</p>
    <p>Eating patatas bravas also comes with an unspoken performance requirement: you must confidently declare 
        them “the best you’ve ever had” while gesturing vaguely at the plate, even if you burned your mouth and 
        can no longer taste anything. I will insist they are superior to any version I’ve had back home, mostly 
        because saying otherwise feels dangerous. In the end, I leave full, happy, and mildly confused, wondering 
        how something so simple can inspire such passion — and secretly hoping no one asks me to explain what makes 
        them <em>authentic</em>.
