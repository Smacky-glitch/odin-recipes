    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Potato chips are basically the rock stars of the snack world — thin, crunchy, and salty enough to make your taste 
        buds throw a party. There’s something scientifically suspicious about the way they disappear faster than you can 
        say “just one more,” like they have tiny little legs and a mission to make you snack forever. Plus, they somehow 
        manage to be both totally casual and irresistibly fancy — you can eat them while binge-watching TV or at a fancy 
        cocktail party, and somehow nobody judges.</p>
    <p>And let’s be honest: there’s a magical combination at work. The crunch, the salt, the slight grease that somehow 
        feels indulgent but not enough to require a nap afterward — it’s basically a snack sorcery. Potato chips also have 
        a weirdly comforting quality, like eating them somehow tells your brain, “Everything’s going to be fine, for now.” 
        So yes, they’re basically snack perfection, with just enough guilty pleasure to make you smile while reaching for 
        the next handful.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cooking Spray</strong></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of <strong>Vegetable Oil</strong></li>
        <li>1 <strong>Potato</strong></li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of <strong>Salt</strong> <em>to taste></em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>STEP 1</strong> <em>Lightly grease a large dinner plate with cooking spray; set aside.
        </em></li>
        <li><strong>STEP 2</strong> <em>Pour oil into a plastic bag (a produce bag works well). 
            Add potato slices and shake to coat. Arrange potato slices in a single layer on the prepared plate.
        </em></li>
        <li><strong>STEP 3</strong> <em>Cook in the microwave on high until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Remove chips to a large bowl and toss with salt. Chips will crisp as they cool. Repeat with 
            remaining potato slices; no need to grease the plate again.
        </em></li>
        <li><strong>STEP 4</strong> <em>Enjoy!</em></li>
    </ol>
